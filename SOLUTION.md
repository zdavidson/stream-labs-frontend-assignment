- How long did it take you to complete this assignment?
  About 6 hours in total.

- What about this assignment did you find most challenging?
  Working with the API was probably the most challenging since I wasn't familiar with it prior to this assignment.

- What about this assignment did you find unclear?
  I wasn't clear on whether images were to be used or I was meant to utilize the MediaStream's API to enable the camera, so I made the assumption that the goal was to use the API as completely as possible and implemented that functionality.

- What challenges did you face that you did not expect?
  I didn't expect that getting the stream to appear in two places simultaneously would prove to be such a challenge, but I studied the documentation and found an answer.

- Do you feel like this assignment has an appropriate level of difficulty?
  Yes, and I think if I were familiar with the MediaStream API it would have been completed in have the time.

- Briefly explain your decisions to use tools, frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, etc.
  I decided to use React because it's the library that I'm most familiar with and would therefore save the most time by using. I chose to use SCSS because I prefer the structure of the styling -- I think it comes out much cleaner than CSS.

- Did you make certain assumptions and decisions around the UI/UX? Please elaborate on your reasonings.
